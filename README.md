# pulsar-client-cpp-perf

The **independent** performance tool for the Pulsar C++ client.

Though you can also build the tool in the [official repository](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-cpp/tree/main/perf), this project don't require you to build the Pulsar C++ client library from source. You can install the client library from the pre-built binanry first, see [here](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/3.1.x/client-libraries-cpp-setup/) for more details.
